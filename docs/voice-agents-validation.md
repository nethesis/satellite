# Alpha validation

## Caller greeting and attended-transfer gates — 2026-10-27

Starting sources: Satellite `03eb3dcf84eface5cc8eee3a24ca6cf026bb70dc` and
NethVoice `54b42f8714df2adce228b8696da70aeda6a33170`. New branches are
`voice_agents_attended_transfer`, targeting `voice_agents` in each repository.

The runtime now pins the PBX caller display name at admission, strips controls,
bounds it to 256 UTF-8 bytes and passes it as untrusted opening context. First-name
selection is left to the model, with explicit neutral-fallback and language
guidance. No publication, manifest, database, persisted name or grant changes.

Validation: 49 greeting cases passed; the full standalone foundation suite passed
292 cases with five database cases skipped. The paired PHP/MariaDB/runtime
harness passed all 297 runtime cases plus native dialplan, setup repetition,
interruption, restore, immutable contracts and least-privilege checks. Nine native
PHP transcription regressions passed. Existing aiohttp deprecation warnings remain;
the optional full Wizard HTTP authentication harness was not selected.

An isolated native `Bridge()` proof on staging Asterisk 22.10.0 passed using two
synthetic answered Local channels and the existing images. Both exact IDs entered
one basic bridge and emitted `StasisEnd`; the bridge survived test-controller
disconnect and the original absolute timeout. Full Local `;1` channel names are
required to avoid prefix matching the `;2` peer. Passive ARI subscriptions remain
listed after release; use `StasisEnd` for ownership evidence. Cleanup left zero
calls and unchanged containers. No staff/external calls, provider connections,
service restarts, new image deployment or human audio acceptance occurred.

**Incomplete feature:** the existing CTI middleware v0.7.0 and chat gateway have
no scoped, human-session-independent presence/chat-permission service read.
An upstream prerequisite and verified versioned image are required before
consultation integration. Attended transfer, new contracts, colleague sessions,
chat, clarification, administration UI and production handoff remain unimplemented
and disabled. The primitive proof does not establish production media privacy,
recording/CDR continuity or actual Satellite-shutdown survival. See the sibling
NethVoice integration record for the repeatable probe and exact image identities.

The cleanup starts from NethVoice `d1e23cae8f286af401397afa290cf5fe94d09d30`
and Satellite `327b714ed977970afe1ac97fd9a5fc9af839c94a`, including the
separately preserved callback and compact-channel-ID fixes. Recovery bundles,
tracked patches, untracked files and previous development notes are retained
outside published documentation.

The rewritten branches incorporate current main: NethVoice
`1da25a1554b5a0c0ab350c7cd01079f9f3fb07d7`, Satellite
`1599a81f9ea96f4aea47d2121252267c10976f5f`. Current executable runtime code
is introduced by Satellite's call-execution commit; the paired NethVoice runtime
pin identifies the published base image; CI tests its matching source revision.
Python remains 3.12.13.

| Gate | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Fresh baseline, unsupported development DB rejection, interrupted retry | Disposable MariaDB; old objects unchanged on rejection; seed and repeated setup verified |
| Paired PHP/Python, provider emulators, ARI, routing and recovery | 266 runtime tests passed, including real disposable DB integration |
| Server authorization, CSRF, immutable publications, grants and restore | PHP/MariaDB harness passed, including separate runtime accounts |
| Native CDR/CEL identifier bounds | Strict native field limits reject UUID-sized channel IDs; compact Local identities and independent session/run correlation persist |
| UI type/lint/format/unit/build/browser | Passed; seven unit tests and 27 browser cases |
| Transcription | 137 Python tests passed, one skipped; nine PHP segmentation regressions passed |
| NS8 unit regressions | 89 passed, including 14 subtests |
| EN/IT administrator manual | Docusaurus built both locales; existing browser-data-age warnings remain |

Staging validation uses a disposable instance. A protected backup includes databases,
secret/environment files, native PBX state, service overrides and exact images.
The pre-reset databases were restored on an isolated MariaDB server before reset;
old image identities are pinned for rollback. This rehearses the database portion,
not a full NS8 machine recovery. Native CDR and unrelated PBX tables matched their
pre-reset fingerprints after installation and supported configuration recreation.

A fresh Receptionist was disabled/unpublished before its test configuration was
saved and published. Runtime readiness requires authentication, reports v8 with
four tools and no monitoring degradation. Both services run independently of
transcription enablement. Installation repetition preserves the current publication.

## Controlled staging observations

- GPT-Live primary WebSocket: caller-side audio was observed; a synthetic goodbye
  invoked the enabled hangup tool and ended as `ended_by_agent`, leaving no channels.
  First caller-side signal energy was about 3.58 seconds in that trial. This is not
  a human listening or intelligibility measurement.
- OpenAI Realtime SIP: an approved extension transfer recorded both native handoff
  and `transferred`, then left zero channels. The test target was a controlled,
  unregistered native extension with safe native hold fallback, not an employee
  answering a telephone.
- A denied destination was not reached. An independent registry check using the
  real restricted DB account returned one approved directory target and one
  callback candidate, rejected the other extension and performed no ARI action.
- Killing only the runner during one owned call exercised supervisor/recovery.
  The run became `interrupted / runtime_restarted`, with zero remaining channels.
- A deadline trial exposed the native watchdog firing before the runtime because
  its seconds were rounded down. The failing regression and fix keep the runtime
  deadline authoritative and add bounded native-watchdog grace. The corrected
  live trial recorded `fallback / duration_exceeded` and left zero channels.
- Actual native CDR/daily CDR/CEL probes retained compact provider/consult Local
  identities, both CEL halves and independent session correlation under strict
  SQL limits, without provider connections or container replacement.

GPT-Live spoken-name transfer and both GPT-Live/Realtime callback trials did
not establish a confirmed handoff. The controlled provider windows closed after
ten attempts; synthetic CDR and test-extension fixtures were removed. Defaults
were restored, services remained healthy and zero channels remained. Do not count their ordinary completion as transfer success. Human
listening, subjective barge-in, long-duration calls, actual employee-answer
confirmation, Grok live coverage and coexistence under sustained transcription
load remain separate acceptance gates. Never infer these from provider
acceptance, media events or signal-energy measurements.

## Image and source provenance

The full Satellite image was built with Python 3.12.13, UID/GID 65532, v8-only
contracts and the exact current runtime source; source-only diagnostics are absent.
The standalone runner image was also built. Staging uses source-verified feature
overlays on the saved installed image identities, including the watchdog fix.
Exact image hashes and deployment receipts remain in protected local verification
material, outside published documentation. FreePBX/module image results and the pinned published Satellite image digest
are recorded with the paired NethVoice source. Verify that final pair before
publishing a release. Local Docker builds omit optional BuildKit cache mounts
where the host has no BuildKit plugin; production build recipes are unchanged.

## CleverAI local integration — 2026-10-26

Starting revisions: NethVoice `c2729414d6ca2c5e264416b33ee66b22b8a544e3`,
Satellite `6ad35f66af1071e088e3905aa92eb596e2068416`, both on `voice_agents`.
The existing PRs were open and their remote heads matched these revisions.
Pre-existing NethVoice changes were saved as a patch before editing and preserved,
including the shared `retrieveHelper.sh` reload request and deletion of the old
agent-specific checker. No commits, pushes, builds, deployment or provider calls
were performed. Satellite runtime code, publication schemas and runtime pin were
not changed.

Automated checks passed:

- Disposable MariaDB/PHP foundation harness, including fresh-install rejection,
  interrupted setup, repeated setup, immutable snapshots, restore and least-privilege
  accounts. The CleverAI service regression also covers credential omission without
  an encryption key or environment discovery, both directions of trunk compatibility,
  forbidden local settings, Save activation/reload failure/retry, native readiness,
  VisualPlan fallback/cycles, stable identities, revisions and in-use deletion guards.
- Native dialplan generation using FreePBX extension classes from the existing alpha
  image: four inherited SIP headers, PBX caller/DID sources, empty-DID fallback,
  managed-trunk Dial with the existing 20-second connection timeout, failure fallback,
  ANSWER/CANCEL termination guard, unconnected fallback and absence of Stasis/agent
  events. Fallback uses a pinned resolved native destination across reloads.
- 266 Satellite foundation tests, paired runner contract and native CDR/CEL checks.
  CleverAI has no runtime publication or binding visibility and creates no synthetic
  run. Existing local OpenAI/Grok runtime behavior remains covered.
- UI type checking, lint, formatting and seven unit tests; nine focused browser
  cases covering CleverAI trunk/create/edit/delete, local publishing and EN/IT
  monitoring. Four NS8 agent-review tests and all nine native transcription
  regressions passed.

The optional full Wizard HTTP authentication harness was skipped because
`M0_REST_AUTOLOAD` was not selected; existing access-envelope/CSRF checks passed.
The initial system-Python run lacked runtime dependencies; the successful harness
used the existing Python 3.12 test environment. Existing dependency deprecation
warnings remain. No new dependencies were added.

**External acceptance still required:** no real CleverAI call, wire-level SIP/audio
check, human audio acceptance or external webhook provisioning was performed.
The full experimental dialplan was not available locally. `agent:<agent_id>` is
only the proposed stable `X-OS-Extension` identity; CleverAI's required registration
or accepted value, and its handling of empty caller headers, remain unconfirmed.
The generated failure/hangup paths are checked automatically, not proven against
CleverAI/Asterisk live calls. Transfers back to NethVoice remain deferred.

Changes are confined to the PHP service/native projection/dialplan, Agents UI and
translations, the runtime binding view's external-execution filter, focused tests
and maintained guides/validation notes. There are no table or publication-contract
migrations and no development database conversion or erasure. To revert this local
work, remove only the CleverAI additions while retaining the separately preserved
pre-existing changes; do not reset the working trees wholesale. Local logs and the
pre-existing patch are under `/tmp/cleverai-*` and are not release artifacts.


## Published Satellite base — 2026-10-26

NethVoice now consumes `ghcr.io/nethesis/satellite:pr-56`, verified in GHCR and
pinned to `sha256:e7b765730884612500658824857c02b4ff7f2191d40768b40ebbd81fb1d7479b`.
The image's source label is `407c73f266ab528267e28251beefdc1fc41e44ac`, the PR merge
revision; its Git tree matches head `6ad35f66af1071e088e3905aa92eb596e2068416`.
NethVoice CI checks out the exact image source revision for paired tests.

Both entrypoints imported successfully in the downloaded image under Python
3.12.13. Build-script smoke checks passed for the pinned default, local override,
launcher/user setup and import-failure rejection. Shell syntax, CI YAML and diff
checks passed. No full image build, hosted CI, deployment or provider calls ran.
The source-archive results above remain historical evidence.

**Merge gate:** replace the development PR image with a versioned Satellite
release; update its digest and the matching CI source revision together.


## Shared Python lifecycle — 2026-10-26

The refactor starts from NethVoice `c2729414d6ca2c5e264416b33ee66b22b8a544e3`
and Satellite `6ad35f66af1071e088e3905aa92eb596e2068416`, both on `voice_agents`.
Both PRs were open with matching remote heads. Existing uncommitted work,
including the preceding action/build cleanup and CleverAI changes, was preserved.

`main.py` now owns the application lifecycle and both private HTTP servers on one
event loop. `transcription.py` owns optional pipeline startup/retry/cleanup;
`voice_agent/` retains call handling and its separate ARI application. Both current
transcription flags, endpoint paths, authentication, credentials, schema and stored
volumes remain in place. No persistent data was converted or removed. The obsolete
NethVoice subprocess launcher and its supervisor-specific tests were removed.
Normal MQTT/ARI failures recover within transcription. Shutdown cancels connector
starts and connection tasks, closes transcription-owned media/RTP resources, drains
HTTP requests and kills/reaps expired enrichment/ffmpeg workers. PostgreSQL connection
attempts are bounded and startup schema work runs off the shared event loop.

Python 3.12 validation:

- Satellite runtime foundation: **261 passed, 5 skipped** (database-backed cases
  require the disposable integration harness).
- Satellite transcription/application: **156 passed, 1 skipped** (real Deepgram round-trip
  requires provider credentials); existing aiohttp BasicAuth deprecation warnings remain.
- Connector cleanup checks after adding concurrent-close coverage: **7 passed**.
- NethVoice packaging and lifecycle checks: **28 passed**.
- Actual SIGTERM/SIGINT shutdown and HTTP auth/path isolation passed for all four
  transcription-flag combinations. A synthetic active agent call/runtime survived
  transcription startup failure and recovery. Real disposable worker processes
  were reaped on timeout, request cancellation and API shutdown.
- Current source started/stopped in both modes as UID 65532 using the existing
  published image's dependencies, with a read-only test source mount and no network.
  This validates dependency compatibility; it is not a rebuilt/published image.
- Shell syntax and both repository diff checks passed.

The pinned PR #56 image predates the shared lifecycle. NethVoice deliberately
rejects it at the import check. **Publish the updated Satellite image, refresh the
image digest and CI source revision together, and replace the PR image with a
versioned release before merge.** A local updated image can use `SATELLITE_IMAGE`.

No commits, pushes, full image builds, deployment, real PBX/provider calls or
human audio acceptance were performed. A fatal process failure now affects both
components and is recovered by systemd; ordinary connection errors stay local.
The earlier subprocess-supervisor and image observations above are historical.


## IVR routing removed — 2026-10-26

The product decision removes IVRs from agent routing and the roadmap. Starting
revisions are NethVoice `47cb49b1826dd80a4a16ffdd07b30de701353b25` and Satellite
`f39996479009a8e9a0ff05d05ea6d0379f9d03f3`, both on `voice_agents`.

Native inventory, REST searches, agent dialplan wrappers, runtime target reads,
menu traversal, routing authorization, model advertisements and UI metadata now
support extensions and queues only. Recent-caller callbacks remain independent.
A saved v8 IVR flag cannot authorize discovery or transfer. OpenAI Realtime's
strict advertisement projection accepts the known narrowed schema and continues
to reject unknown schemas; other providers retain the runtime's one-of constraint.

The immutable v8 schema/tool JSON files and existing publications are unchanged.
Retired wire fields are inert. Two empty read-only compatibility views keep the
currently pinned runtime's queries working during a matching-image upgrade;
they expose no IVR inventory or branch data. Native FreePBX IVR records and
administrator-selected VisualPlan fallback routes are preserved. Workspace
instructions and the local release plan explicitly exclude future IVR activation.

Validation passed: the disposable PHP/MariaDB/auth/native-dialplan/restore harness
including **265 runtime tests**; **36 focused routing/greeting tests** and **18
provider/callback tests**; UI type/lint/format checks, **seven UI unit tests**, the
production build and browser regressions. Repeated installation preserves native
IVR data, drafts, credentials, immutable publications and the canonical catalog.
No commit, push, deployment or real provider calls were performed for this removal.

### Attended announcement and failure recovery regression

The attended tool now continues the Live backend after submitting its result,
then waits for speech followed by one second of quiet at the paced PBX media
writer. Context acknowledgements remain correlated by client event ID and do
not count as speech. Continuous silent Live frames do not require an empty
queue. This is an audio activity boundary, not verification of spoken wording;
real listening remains an acceptance gate.

Announcement, native hold, recipient lookup, origination and private provider
failures carry bounded stage codes. Recovery stops the private leg and native
music before reporting the result. A failed caller recovery immediately uses
the configured native fallback. Caller-session termination also stops owned
hold music. The native recipient contract uses Asterisk hint state `0` for an
idle phone; friendly presence labels are not substituted for that state.

Local verification: 357 paired database/runtime tests, 79 focused tests and nine
transcription regressions passed. These checks do not establish real ringing,
audible music, private assistant audio, consent or a two-way human conversation.
